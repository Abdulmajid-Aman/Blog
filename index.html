    <h1>Building a User Management Application with Javascript and Localhost API</h1>
    <p>Managing user data is a fundamental requirement for many web applications. In this blog, we will explore how to build a user management application using JavaScript and a localhost API. This application will allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles, providing a comprehensive example of handling user interactions and API calls.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our user management application includes the following functionalities</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Sign up:</b> Users can sign up for an account by providing their name, email
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Log in:</b> Users can log in to their account by providing their email and password
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Profile management:</b> Users can manage their profile by updating their name, email, and password
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Profile Display:</b> Once logged in, users can see their profile information, including username, bio and posts
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <p>Our user management application uses the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>HTML:</b> For the structure of the application
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>CSS:</b> For styling the structure of the application
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>JavaScript:</b> For handling user interactions and API calls
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>API</h2>
    <p>Our user management application uses a localhost API to store and retrieve user data.
        The API is built using Node.js and Express.js and is hosted on localhost:3000.
        The API provides the following endpoints:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>/users:</b> Returns a list of all users
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>/users/:id:</b> Returns a specific user based on their ID
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>/users/:id/posts:</b> Returns a list of all posts made by a user 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>/users/:id/posts/:post_id:</b> Returns a specific post made by a user
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>/users/:id/patch:</b> Updates a user's profile information
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>/users/:id/delete:</b> Deletes a user's account
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our user management application provides a simple and intuitive way for users to manage their profiles
            and interact with other users. The application is built using modern technologies and is easy to use and
            understand. The API provides a robust set of endpoints for retrieving and updating user data, making it
            easy to integrate with other applications. Overall, our user management application is a great tool for
            managing user profiles and interacting with other users.</p>
